# **League VOD Manager üìΩÔ∏è**

Welcome to the League VOD Manager! This program will be designed to easily search and display high elo vods.

In the future, I would like to expand upon this project by adding more visuals, channels, and filters. In this current iteration, Streamlit is used to host the website and python framework, while YouTube API was used to retrieve video data.

Special thanks to *[Challenger Replays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVz2qkd_oGXGC66fcH4SFA/featured)* as it was the  sole source I used to obtain video data. The way their channel is structured made it easy to search through and obtain videos for all champions. To increase the sample size, I was also planning to use *[Dominus Replays](https://www.youtube.com/@domisumReplay)* as they have a format very similar to *[Challenger Replays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVz2qkd_oGXGC66fcH4SFA/featured)*, as well as having separate channels entirely dedicated to each respective champion to which can be implemented via a dictionary.
